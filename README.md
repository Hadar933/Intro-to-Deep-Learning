## Exercises
* ex1 - implementing **MLP** to identify peptides from the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
* ex2 - comparing **Elman network** (basic RNN), **GRU cell**, and **MLP** with **restricted self-attention layer** in classifying movie reviews as positive or negative
* ex3 - using **GAN** and conditional GAN (**cGAN**) to generate novel samples of the MNIST dataset
